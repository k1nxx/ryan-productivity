# Productivity Extensions

## About

Here is a list of all the productivity extensions i've found useful throughout my journey of developing in a multitude of languages in Visual Studio Code.

## Official website

For information about the Extensions and their use-case you can follow [this page](https://k1nxx.github.io/blog/ryan-productivity/)

## Other projects

I do have a list of other extensions tailored to specific needs and programming languages, you can find each of them accordingly on my developer page(search: "Ryan Samaeian" in the vscode search bar) or look into my github repository

## Usecases

Alot of people install unwanted extensions without any clue as what their usecase is. As for this being a productivity specific extension i find it valuable to tell you why these were choosen and how they would benefit you. Follow my github for more information on that
